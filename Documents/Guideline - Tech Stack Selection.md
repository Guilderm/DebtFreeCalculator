# Technology Stack Criteria Guidance

**Note:** "Technology" encompasses a broad range of tools and platforms, including frameworks (e.g., N-Tier, layered architecture; .NET, React), programming languages (e.g., C#, JavaScript), Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings (e.g., AWS, Azure), and libraries and plugins (e.g., Jest).

## 1. Technical Considerations

### 1.1 Ecosystem

Integrates and interoperates seamlessly with existing tools, platforms, and services used in the project.

### 1.2 Portability

The ability to migrate the application across different environments or platforms, preventing vendor lock-in.

### 1.3 Security

Adheres to industry-standard security practices and maintains a strong record of addressing vulnerabilities and security concerns.

## 2. Support and Community

### 2.1 Support

Provides adequate technical support from maintainers and the community.

### 2.2 Community

The size, activity, and vibrancy of the community. A strong community means more plugins, extensions, and shared knowledge, contributing to an overall better ecosystem.

### 2.3 Documentation

Includes comprehensive documentation, such as tutorials and user guides.

### 2.4 Training

Offers training materials, courses, and tutorials.

## 3. Licensing

### 3.1 Free Tier

Offers a free tier generous enough to facilitate development and testing at low or no cost before market adoption.

### 3.2 Cost

Analyzes the total cost of ownership, including licensing fees, subscription costs, and expenses related to scaling and maintenance.

### 3.3 Compliance

Complies with relevant industry regulations and standards, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS.

## 4. Maintenance

### 4.1 Maintainer

Assesses the financial stability and commitment of the maintainers to ensure ongoing support and development.

### 4.2 EOL Status

Avoids technologies marked as end-of-life or those experiencing declining community support, which can lead to security risks and lack of updates.

### 4.3 LTSR Availability

Favors technologies that offer long-term service releases or have a mature, stable codebase.

### 4.4 Technical Debt

How well do they remove there legagy code and outdated ways of doing things

## 5. UX

### 5.1 Ergonomics

Provides an intuitive development experience with a good user interface (UI) and a quick learning curve.

### 5.2 Tooling

Ensures compatibility with and support from a wide range of development tools, such as Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), debuggers, CI/CD pipelines, and testing frameworks.

### 5.3 Flexibility and Customization

Allows for customization and adaptability to meet specific project needs without excessive constraints.

Performance and Scalability: Consider adding a section that explicitly addresses the performance characteristics and scalability potential of technologies. This ensures that the chosen stack can handle the expected load and future growth.

Integration Capabilities: Include criteria for how well a technology integrates with other systems and services, especially considering potential future integrations like third-party APIs or services.

Maturity and Stability: While you touch on maintenance and EOL status, it might be beneficial to explicitly assess the maturity level of the technology and its track record in production environments.

Community Size vs. Activity: In the Community section, consider not just the size but also the activity level and health of the community. A smaller but highly active community might be more beneficial than a larger, stagnant one.

Ecosystem Tooling: Under Tooling, you might want to specify the importance of ecosystem tooling, such as libraries, plugins, and extensions that can accelerate development.
