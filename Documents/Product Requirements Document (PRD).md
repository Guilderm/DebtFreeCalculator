# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

This PRD lays the groundwork for the DebtFreePlanner by clearly defining the product’s purpose and target audience. The structure and content of this document are guided by the principles and methodologies outlined in [*Design a Better Business: New Tools, Skills, and Mindset for Strategy and Innovation*](https://designabetterbusiness.com/) by Pijl, Lokitz, and Solomon (2016). Additionally, insights from the [Product Mastery Now](https://productmasterynow.com/mastery/) podcast shape the approach, particularly within the "design and development" knowledge area of the "product innovation management" framework.

## 3. Background

### 3.1. Problem Statement
Individuals struggle to manage multiple debts, leading to prolonged financial strain. This challenge arises from a lack of tools and knowledge that support practical debt management strategies such as Snowball, Avalanche, and Snowflake, as well as multicurrency support. Loan recipients need resources to create debt repayment plans that reduce the interest paid and increase their amortization, thereby shortening the time required to become debt-free.

### 3.2. Competitive Landscape
The DebtFreePlanner faces competition from both general financial management apps and dedicated debt repayment tools.
Individuals managing multiple debts often struggle to estimate their debt-free date or the total interest their debts will incur due to inadequate tools and education.

### 2.2. Market Opportunity
Existing personal financial management applications primarily focus on general budgeting and expense tracking, neglecting the specific needs of loan recipients who require a structured debt repayment plan. The DebtFreePlanner app addresses this gap and captures a niche market of users motivated to optimize their debt repayment process. By offering a tool that leverages popular strategies like Snowball, Avalanche, and Snowflake, and provides multicurrency support, the DebtFreePlanner enables users to create a tailored debt repayment plan.

- **Direct Competitors:** [Debt Payoff Planner](https://www.debtpayoffplanner.com/), [Undebt.it](https://undebt.it/), [unbury.me](https://unbury.me/), and [Vertex42 Debt Reduction Calculator](https://www.vertex42.com/Calculators/debt-reduction-calculator.html) are focused on helping users manage and pay down debt using popular strategies like Snowball and Avalanche. However, none of these tools offer multicurrency support or the ability to customize debt repayment plans as extensively as the DebtFreePlanner. These tools primarily cater to users who want straightforward debt repayment solutions but lack the advanced features that the DebtFreePlanner provides.

- **General Competitors:** Mint, [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/), [Quicken](https://www.quicken.com/), [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/), and [Simplifi](https://www.quicken.com/simplifi) are popular tools that offer a wide range of financial management features, including budgeting, expense tracking, and investment management. However, they do not provide features that support the creation of debt repayment strategies. Among these, YNAB is the only tool that offers an official, well-documented API that could be used to pull data into the DebtFreePlanner. While Mint does not officially offer a public API, there are unofficial third-party APIs that have been developed to interact with Mint’s data.

- **Differentiation:** The DebtFreePlanner stands out in this competitive landscape by offering a highly specialized tool that caters directly to the needs of loan recipients. Its focus on advanced debt repayment strategies, including the unique Hybrid Debt Repayment Strategy, multicurrency support, and customizable debt plans, provides a unique value proposition that is not fully addressed by any existing mainstream financial management tools. This specialization positions the DebtFreePlanner as the go-to solution for users serious about optimizing their debt repayment process and achieving financial freedom.


### 3.3. Solution and Value Proposition
Unlike general budgeting apps, the DebtFreePlanner focuses exclusively on debt repayment, combining advanced features that are rarely found together:

- **Multiple Repayment Strategies:** The tool includes the Snowball, Avalanche, and Snowflake strategies, allowing users to select the approach that best aligns with their financial goals. This flexibility ensures users can adopt a strategy that maximizes their debt repayment efficiency.
  
- **Multicurrency Support:** Recognizing the global nature of debt, the DebtFreePlanner provides multicurrency support, making it suitable for users with loans in various currencies. This feature is especially valuable for expatriates, international students, and professionals managing debts across borders.
  
- **Customizable Debt Plans:** Users can create and modify debt repayment plans according to their specific needs. The tool allows for one-time or recurring extra payments, adjustment of repayment priorities, and real-time progress tracking.
