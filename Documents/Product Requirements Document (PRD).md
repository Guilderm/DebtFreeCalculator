# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

This PRD lays the groundwork for the DebtFreePlanner by clearly defining the productâ€™s purpose and target audience. The structure and content of this document are guided by the principles and methodologies outlined in [_Design a Better Business: New Tools, Skills, and Mindset for Strategy and Innovation_](https://designabetterbusiness.com/) by Pijl, Lokitz, and Solomon (2016). Additionally, insights from the [Product Mastery Now](https://productmasterynow.com/mastery/) podcast shape the approach, particularly within the "design and development" knowledge area of the "product innovation management" framework.

## 3. Market and Context

### 3.1. Problem Statement

Loan recipients struggle to manage multiple debts, leading to prolonged financial strain. This challenge arises from a lack of tools and knowledge that support practical debt management strategies such as Snowball, Avalanche, and Snowflake, as well as multicurrency support.

### 3.2. Market Analysis

#### 3.2.1. Direct Competitors

Direct competitors like [Debt Payoff Planner](https://www.debtpayoffplanner.com/), [Undebt.it](https://undebt.it/), [unbury.me](https://unbury.me/), and [Vertex42 Debt Reduction Calculator](https://www.vertex42.com/Calculators/debt-reduction-calculator.html) help users manage and pay down debt using strategies like Snowball and Avalanche. However, these tools lack multicurrency support and the ability to customize debt repayment plans as extensively as DebtFreePlanner.

#### 3.2.2. Indirect Competitors

Indirect competitors such as [Mint](https://www.mint.com/), [YNAB](https://www.youneedabudget.com/), [Quicken](https://www.quicken.com/), [Personal Capital](https://www.personalcapital.com/), and [Simplifi](https://www.quicken.com/simplifi) offer a broad range of financial management features, including budgeting and expense tracking, but do not support creating debt repayment plans.

#### 3.2.3. Strategic Opportunities

1. **Multicurrency Support**: None of the direct competitors offer multicurrency support or localization. DebtFreePlanner addresses this gap, making it uniquely suited for a global user base and providing a significant advantage in catering to diverse financial needs across different regions.

2. **AI-Driven Insights**: The use of AI for personalized recommendations and predictive analytics is an emerging area that none of the competitors have yet to fully embrace. While AI-driven insights are currently not on the roadmap, if implemented, DebtFreePlanner would be the first in the market to offer such advanced functionality, further solidifying its position as an innovative leader in debt management.

3. **API Integrations**: YNAB offers a well-documented official API that can be used to pull loans into DebtFreePlanner. This integration can be leveraged to create a symbiotic relationship, enhancing the overall user experience and data synchronization between the two tools.

### 3.3. Assumptions and Limitations

#### 3.3.1. Assumptions

- **Basic Financial Literacy:** Users have a basic understanding of financial concepts, such as compound interest and loan terms.
- **Basic Technology Proficiency:** Users are comfortable using online banking and personal finance apps.
- **Basic Computer Setup:** The application is primarily used on a laptop with an internet connection.
- **Data Accuracy:** Users will input correct financial information to ensure accurate calculations.

#### 3.3.2. Limitations

- **Data Privacy:** In addition to standard data privacy measures, DebtFreePlanner must implement GDPR and CCPA.
- **Platform Limitations:** DebtFreePlanner is designed as a web-based tool, which may limit its functionality on certain devices or when used offline.

#### 3.3.3. Risks

- **External Service Dependency Risks:** The tool may face challenges with the integration and reliability of third-party APIs and services.
- **Public Repository Exposure:** Because this is a portfolio project, the repository is public, increasing the likelihood of a successful cyberattack.
- **Attractiveness as a Target:** Since the app manages financial data, it is an attractive target (honeypot) for cybercriminals.

## 6. Value Proposition

DebtFreePlanner offers a web-based solution that loan recipients can use to create a debt repayment plans that accelerate their journey to financial freedom.

### 6.1. Feature Set

#### 6.1.1. Primary Features

- **Multiple Repayment Strategies**
  - Supports a variety of debt repayment methods, including Snowball, Avalanche, Debt-to-Interest Ratio, Cash Flow Index (CFI), Highest Monthly Payment, and Custom Strategies.

- **Snowflake Payments**
  - Enables small, irregular payments towards debts whenever extra funds are available, helping to reduce the principal faster.

- **Multicurrency Support**
  - Provides seamless handling of multiple currencies with automatic exchange rate updates, catering to a global user base.

- **Basic Reporting**
  - Generates essential reports and visualizations to help loan recipients understand and track their repayment plans.

- **Secure Data Handling:**
   - The application ensures that all sensitive user data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.


#### 6.1.2. Secondary Features

- **Data Portability:**
   - Users can export and import their data, allowing them to maintain control over their information and use it in other financial tools or reports.

- **Integration with Financial Tools**
  - Synchronizes with budgeting applications like YNAB and possibly Firefly III for seamless data management.

- **Advanced Reporting**
  - Offers enhanced reporting and visualizations that incorporate data storytelling techniques to provide deeper insights.


#### 6.1.3. Potential Features
The following features are under consideration for future development but are not yet confirmed or scheduled for implementation.

- **Multi-User Support**
  - Allows collaboration on debt management under a single account, ideal for households and financial advisors.

- **AI-Driven Insights**
  - Provides personalized recommendations and predictive analytics to optimize repayment strategies.

- **Cross-Platform Accessibility**
  - Ensures accessibility across multiple devices, enhancing usability and engagement wherever the user is.

#### 6.1.4. Excluded Features
To ensure DebtFreePlanner remains focused on fulfilling its intended purpose, the following features and functionalities were deemed unviable due to the complexity of their implementation or specific market needs.

- **Budgeting and Expense Tracking**
  - DebtFreePlanner will not include general budgeting or expense tracking features, including loan payment history tracking. These functionalities are excluded because many established applications already perform them well, and these features are complementary rather than central to the problem DebtFreePlanner is addressing. Users are encouraged to use tools like YNAB (You Need A Budget) or Firefly III, which may be integrated with DebtFreePlanner in the future.

- **Non-Conventional Loan Types**
  - DebtFreePlanner will only support the most common loan types (e.g., mortgages, student loans, and credit card debt). Non-conventional loan types, such as payday loans, interest-only loans, or cryptocurrency loans, are not supported due to a lack of market demand.

- **Advanced Loan Features**
  - Advanced loan features, such as variable interest rates and early termination fees, are out of scope due to the complexity of accommodating all possible business rules of financial institutions. Users will need to update loan terms manually when they change.

- **Business-Oriented Features**
  - DebtFreePlanner will not offer features intended primarily for business owners, given that large businesses would likely not trust this tool, and features targeting personal finances can typically meet the needs of small business owners.

### 6.2. Gain Creators

- Reduce interest payments, accelerating the journey to financial independence.
- Provide clear, actionable insights to improve financial health.

### 6.3. Pain Relievers

- Simplify the process of managing multiple debts, reducing financial stress.
- Integrate with existing financial tools for a seamless user experience.
