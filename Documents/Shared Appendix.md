## 1. Glossary of Terms

This section defines key terms used throughout the project's documentation that may be uncommon to developers.

- **Debt Snowball**: A debt repayment strategy where you pay off debts in order of smallest to largest, gaining momentum as each balance is paid off.
- **Debt Avalanche**: A debt repayment strategy where you focus on paying off debts with the highest interest rates first to minimize total interest paid.
- **Debt Hybrid (Debt-to-Interest Ratio)**: A debt repayment strategy that combines aspects of both the Snowball and Avalanche methods by prioritizing debts based on a combination of balance and interest rate, targeting those with a higher cost in terms of both.
- **Cash Flow Index (CFI)**: A strategy that prioritizes debts based on their impact on cash flow. Debts with the lowest Cash Flow Index are targeted first to improve cash flow as quickly as possible.
- **Highest Monthly Payment**: A debt repayment strategy that focuses on paying off the debt with the highest monthly payment first to free up significant cash flow.
- **Highest Credit Utilization**: A strategy that targets debts with the highest credit utilization ratios first to improve credit health by reducing the utilization percentage.
- **Highest Monthly Interest Paid**: A debt repayment strategy that targets the debt with the highest monthly interest payments first to reduce the total interest paid over time.
- **Custom Plan**: A personalized debt repayment strategy that allows individuals to prioritize debts in any order based on their unique financial situation and goals.
- **Acronyms**:
  - **CRUD**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
  - **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation
  - **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act

## 2. Development and Documentation Standards

### Supplementary Guidelines

If something is not covered by the Project-Specific Guidelines, refer to these Supplementary Guidelines:

- **Google Developer Documentation Style Guide**: This guide serves as the foundational reference for all documentation-related practices.
- **Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide**: This guide is the primary reference for all coding standards within the project.

### Project-Specific Guidelines

#### 2.1. Diagrams as Code (DaC)

- **Purpose**: Maintain diagrams, charts, and wireframes as part of the codebase using PlantUML to facilitate easy updates. This practice ensures that visual elements are version-controlled and consistent with the project’s code.
- **Implementation**: 
  - Store PlantUML files in a dedicated diagrams directory within the `Documents/Media` repository path.
  - Use predictable naming conventions for diagram files, e.g., `class-diagram.puml`.
  - Link the generated diagrams within markdown documents using relative paths.

#### 2.2. Writing Tone

The tone of the document should convey authority, professionalism, and clarity.

- **2.2.1 Modestly Confident**: Statements should be assertive without sounding overbearing. Avoid passive language to ensure strong yet respectful communication.
  - **Example**:
    - **Do**: “This guideline is essential for maintaining code quality.”
    - **Don’t**: “It might be helpful to follow this guideline for maintaining code quality.”

- **2.2.2 Neutral Perspective**: The language should focus on the processes and outcomes rather than the individuals performing the tasks. Refrain from using “I,” “we,” “you,” or any other personal pronouns.
  - **Example**:
    - **Do**: “The documents are written in a third-person neutral perspective.”
    - **Don’t**: “We use a third-person perspective when we write documentation.”

- **2.2.3 Plain and Concise**: Use simple, straightforward language. Avoid using ornate language (a style that employs complex sentence structures, rich vocabulary, and figurative language) or purple prose (which involves excessive adjectives, adverbs, and lengthy descriptions).
  - **Example**:
    - **Do**: “Ensure that documentation is clear and concise.”
    - **Don’t**: “Strive to craft documentation that is a paragon of clarity and conciseness.”
