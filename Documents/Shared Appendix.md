## 1. Glossary of Terms
This section defines key terms used throughout the projects documentation, that are uncommon to developers.

- **Debt Snowball**: A debt repayment strategy where you pay off debts in order of smallest to largest, gaining momentum as each balance is paid off.
- **Debt Avalanche**: A debt repayment strategy where you focus on paying off debts with the highest interest rates first to minimize total interest paid.
