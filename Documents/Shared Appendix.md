## 1. Glossary of Terms

This section defines key terms used throughout the project's documentation that may be uncommon to developers.

- **Debt Snowball**: A debt repayment strategy where you pay off debts in order of smallest to largest, gaining momentum as each balance is paid off.
- **Debt Avalanche**: A debt repayment strategy where you focus on paying off debts with the highest interest rates first to minimize total interest paid.
- **Debt Hybrid (Debt-to-Interest Ratio)**: A debt repayment strategy that combines aspects of both the Snowball and Avalanche methods by prioritizing debts based on a combination of balance and interest rate, targeting those with a higher cost in terms of both.
- **Cash Flow Index (CFI)**: A strategy that prioritizes debts based on their impact on cash flow. Debts with the lowest Cash Flow Index are targeted first to improve cash flow as quickly as possible.
- **Highest Monthly Payment**: A debt repayment strategy that focuses on paying off the debt with the highest monthly payment first to free up significant cash flow.
- **Highest Credit Utilization**: A strategy that targets debts with the highest credit utilization ratios first to improve credit health by reducing the utilization percentage.
- **Highest Monthly Interest Paid**: A debt repayment strategy that targets the debt with the highest monthly interest payments first to reduce the total interest paid over time.
- **Custom Plan**: A personalized debt repayment strategy that allows individuals to prioritize debts in any order based on their unique financial situation and goals.
