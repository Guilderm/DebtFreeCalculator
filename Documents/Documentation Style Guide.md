# Documentation Style Guide

Writing Tone
Modestly Confident
Guideline: Use assertive language without sounding overbearing to convey clarity and confidence. Avoid passive constructions.
Do: “This function returns the user’s account balance.”
Don't: “It is hoped that this function might return the user’s account balance.”
Neutral Perspective
Guideline: Write in a neutral third person. Avoid personal pronouns like “I,” “we,” or “you.”
Do: “The application calculates the repayment schedule based on the selected strategy.”
Don't: “We calculate your repayment schedule based on the strategy you select.”
Plain and Concise
Guideline: Use straightforward language and avoid unnecessary jargon or complex sentences.
Do: “Initialize the database connection before executing queries.”
Don't: “Prior to the execution of any query-related operations, it is imperative to ensure the database connection has been properly initialized.”
Consistent Terminology
use the fallow terms: for definition refrence the 'Glossary of Terms' of the shared apendix
"Loan Recipients": Use this term when referring to end-users.
Personas: When appropriate, refer to users by their persona names (e.g., “Taylor, the Debt-Strapped Professional”) in documentation and discussions.
