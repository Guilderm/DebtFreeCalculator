# Threat Model Document

[MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://www.ibm.com/topics/mitre-attack)
[STRIDE model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STRIDE_model)

## Overview of the Application

Description of the system, components, and architecture being modeled.
The purpose of the threat modeling exercise.
Assets Identification:

Key assets that the application must protect (e.g., user data, infrastructure, intellectual property).
Threat Modeling Framework Used:

Specify which threat modeling framework is being used, e.g., STRIDE, MITRE ATT&CK, PASTA, etc., and explain why that framework was chosen.
Data Flow Diagrams (DFD):

Include diagrams that represent how data moves through the application, highlighting trust boundaries and potential entry points for attackers.
Threats Identified:

Use the framework (e.g., STRIDE categories: Spoofing, Tampering, etc.) to list threats associated with each asset or component.
If using MITRE ATT&CK, map adversary tactics and techniques to the identified vulnerabilities.
Risk Assessment:

Assess the likelihood and impact of each identified threat using a risk scoring methodology, such as OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.
Countermeasures and Mitigations:

For each identified threat, propose controls, security measures, or changes in the design to mitigate the risks.
Assumptions and Constraints:

Document any assumptions made during the threat modeling (e.g., which components are out of scope) and any technical or operational constraints that limit security measures.
Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:

Ensure the document considers relevant compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and that identified risks are aligned with regulations.
