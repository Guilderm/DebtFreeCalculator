## Writing Tone

### Modestly Confident

- **Guideline:** Use assertive language without sounding overbearing to convey clarity and confidence. Avoid passive constructions.

  **Do:**  
  "This function returns the user’s account balance."

  **Don't:**  
  "It is hoped that this function might return the user’s account balance."

## Neutral Perspective

- **Guideline:** Write in a neutral third person. Avoid personal pronouns like “I,” “we,” or “you.”

  **Do:**  
  "The application calculates the repayment schedule based on the selected strategy."

  **Don't:**  
  "We calculate your repayment schedule based on the strategy you select."

## Plain and Concise Language

- **Guideline:** Use straightforward language and avoid unnecessary jargon or complex sentences.

  **Do:**  
  "Initialize the database connection before executing queries."

  **Don't:**  
  "Prior to the execution of any query-related operations, it is imperative to ensure the database connection has been properly initialized."

## Consistent Terminology

- **Guideline:** Use consistent terms across documentation. Refer to the 'Glossary of Terms' in the shared appendix for definitions.

  - **Loan Recipients:** Use this term when referring to end-users.
  - **Personas:** When appropriate, refer to users by their persona names (e.g., “Taylor, the Debt-Strapped Professional”) in documentation and discussions.
