Logical organization structures code based on the hierarchy and relationships within the codebase, enhancing readability and maintainability.

**Hierarchy:**

1. **Logical Decisions:** Conditional statements and loops controlling flow within functions.
2. **Functions/Methods:** Blocks of code performing specific tasks.
3. **Classes:** Encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods) in OOP.
4. **Modules/Packages:** Collections of classes organized into files or directories.
5. **Libraries:** Aggregations of modules offering specific functionalities.
6. **Applications/Systems:** Complete software programs built using libraries and modules.
7. **Ecosystems/Platforms:** Larger environments integrating multiple applications and systems.

**Summary Hierarchy:**

Logical Decisions → Functions → Classes → Modules/Packages → Libraries → Applications/Systems → Ecosystems/Platforms
