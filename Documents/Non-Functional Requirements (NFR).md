## Introduction

This document outlines the Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) for the DebtFreePlanner application. These requirements specify criteria that judge the operation of the system, rather than specific behaviors or functionalities. Adherence to these NFRs ensures the application is secure, performant, maintainable, and provides a high-quality user experience.

## Performance Requirements

### P1. Response Time

- **Frontend**: All user interface interactions should have a response time of less than 200 milliseconds to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **Backend API**: All API calls should respond within 500 milliseconds under normal operating conditions.

### P2. Throughput

- The system should support at least 100 concurrent users without significant performance degradation, verified through load testing.

### P3. Load Handling

- The application should handle 1,000 transactions per second during peak times without failing or slowing down.

### P4. Performance Score

- Achieve a Lighthouse performance score of 90 or above on both mobile and desktop platforms.

### P5. Resource Utilization

- Optimize CPU and memory usage to ensure efficient operation on both client and server sides.

## Security Requirements

### S1. Data Encryption

- All sensitive user data must be encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or higher and at rest using AES-256 encryption.

### S2. Authentication and Authorization

- Implement robust authentication mechanisms, including support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Ensure role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to authorized users only.

### S3. Vulnerability Management

- Conduct regular security assessments and code reviews to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Implement automated security scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline.

### S4. Compliance with NIST CSF

Adhere to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions:

- **Identify**: Conduct risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities and threats.
- **Protect**: Implement measures like secure coding practices and access controls.
- **Detect**: Deploy monitoring systems to identify security incidents promptly.
- **Respond**: Develop incident response plans for effective mitigation.
- **Recover**: Establish recovery strategies to restore services post-incident.
- **Govern**: Enforce security policies and manage risks effectively.

### S5. Minimal PII Collection

- Avoid collecting unnecessary Personally Identifiable Information (PII) such as bank account numbers, Social Security numbers, or full names.

### S6. Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention

- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse, including improperly configured applications and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

## Usability Requirements

### U1. Accessibility

- The application must comply with WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.

### U2. Responsiveness

- Ensure full responsiveness across:
  - Mobile devices
  - Tablets
  - Small laptops
  - Large desktops

### U3. Intuitive Interface

- Design a user-friendly interface with clear navigation and minimal learning curve.

### U4. Tutorials and Embedded Learning

- Provide in-app tutorials and contextual help to assist users in understanding features and functionalities.

### U5. Mitigate Intention-Action Gap

- Incorporate features like progress tracking, personalized reminders, and gamification to encourage consistent user engagement.

## Scalability Requirements

### SC1. Horizontal Scalability

- The system architecture should support horizontal scaling to accommodate increased load by adding more instances.

### SC2. Automated Scaling

- Implement automated scaling policies to handle traffic spikes without manual intervention.

### SC3. Modular Architecture

- Design the system using a modular monolithic architecture to allow independent scaling of modules if necessary.

## Maintainability Requirements

### M1. Code Quality

- Achieve 90% code coverage with unit tests across both backend and frontend components.

### M2. Modular Design

- Ensure each module has a single, well-defined responsibility (Single Responsibility Principle).

### M3. Documentation

- Maintain clear and up-to-date documentation for code, APIs, and system architecture.

### M4. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

- Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.

### M5. Vendor-Agnostic Development

- Avoid vendor lock-in by using standard technologies and practices that are not tied to a specific vendor.

## Reliability and Availability Requirements

### R1. Uptime

- The application should have an uptime of 99.9%, excluding scheduled maintenance.

### R2. Fault Tolerance

- Design the system to gracefully handle failures, including third-party service outages, without compromising security or user data.

### R3. Data Consistency

- Ensure data integrity and consistency across all components of the system.

### R4. Disaster Recovery

- Establish recovery strategies to restore services within 1 hour following a critical incident.

## Compliance Requirements

### C1. Data Protection Regulations

- Comply with relevant data protection laws and regulations, such as GDPR for users in applicable regions.

### C2. Secure Development Practices

- Follow industry best practices for secure coding, including OWASP Top Ten guidelines.

## Portability Requirements

### PT1. Browser Compatibility

- Support the latest two versions of major browsers:
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Safari
  - Edge

### PT2. Device Compatibility

- Ensure compatibility across various devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Notes

- These NFRs are integral to the Definition of Done (DoD) for all user stories and must be adhered to throughout the development process.
- Compliance with these requirements should be verified during development, code reviews, and testing phases.
- This document is a living document and may be updated as the project evolves. Team members are encouraged to propose changes or additions as needed.
