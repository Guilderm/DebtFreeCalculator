# User Stories

_Note: This document follows the guidelines outlined in the User Story Guidance. The story points have been adjusted to reflect the capacity of a solo junior developer working part-time._

After each initiative, except Initiative 1, there is a dedicated epic for Comprehensive Quality Improvement. This is intended to ensure continuous enhancement of the application through user testing, code refactoring, and minor updates. However, it is not meant to replace good practices such as Test-Driven Development (TDD), application monitoring, and alerting.

**so that** I can ensure my repayment plan is accurate and aligned with my financial situation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given I have provided debt details (e.g., balance, interest rate, term), when I calculate my monthly payment, then the system should accurately compute the monthly payment using the appropriate formula and display the result.
- Given I provide invalid or incomplete debt details, when I attempt to calculate the monthly payment, then the system should display a clear error message indicating the missing or incorrect information.
- Given I have debts in multiple currencies, when I calculate monthly payments, then the system should convert amounts to my base currency using current exchange rates before performing calculations.

#### User Story 23: Convert Debts to Base Currency

**Story Points:** 10  
**As a** Loan Recipient,  
**I want** to have all my debts converted into a base currency,  
**so that** I can view a consistent total debt amount across multiple currencies.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Given I have debts in various currencies, when I view my debt summary, then the system should automatically convert all debts into my selected base currency using the latest exchange rates.
- Given exchange rates fluctuate, when I refresh or revisit the debt summary, then the system should update the converted amounts to reflect the most recent exchange rates.
- Given I need historical exchange rates, when I input debts with past dates, then the system should allow me to input historical exchange rates applicable at the time of the transaction.

#### User Story 24: Auto-Calculate Missing Fields
