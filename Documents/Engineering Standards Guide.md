# **Engineering Standards Guide**

## **1. Introduction**

The **Engineering Standards Guide** serves as a comprehensive reference for developers working on the **DebtFreePlanner** project. It outlines best practices, coding standards, design principles, and methodologies to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across the codebase and documentation.

### **Handling Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**

We have opted not to create a dedicated Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) document, as indicated in [ADR #1](./docs/adr-guidelines.md). Instead, this **Engineering Standards Guide** defines how developers should handle non-functional aspects such as performance, security, scalability, and maintainability through the following approaches:

- **Reference Industry Standards:**  
  Developers should adhere to established standards and authoritative texts to ensure best practices are followed.

- **Flexibility:**  
  This approach allows for adaptability as new technologies and industry standards evolve, reducing documentation overhead while maintaining high-quality standards.

- **Documentation of Deviations:**  
  Any deviations from standard practices are documented using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), providing clear rationales for alternative approaches.
