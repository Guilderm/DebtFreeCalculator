# Engineering Standards Guide

## 1. Introduction

The **Engineering Standards Guide** serves as a comprehensive reference for developers working on projects within our organization. It outlines best practices, coding standards, design principles, and methodologies to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across codebases and documentation.

### Handling Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

We have opted not to create dedicated Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) documents. Instead, this **Engineering Standards Guide** defines how developers should handle non-functional aspects such as performance, security, scalability, and maintainability through the following approaches:

- **Reference Industry Standards:**  
  Developers should adhere to established standards and authoritative texts to ensure best practices are followed.

- **Flexibility:**  
  This approach allows for adaptability as new technologies and industry standards evolve, reducing documentation overhead while maintaining high-quality standards.

- **Documentation of Deviations:**  
  Any deviations from standard practices are documented using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs), providing clear rationales for alternative approaches.

## 2. Product Management

Effective product management is crucial for the success of projects within our organization. It ensures that products deliver significant value to users, align with business objectives, and adapt to market uncertainties. This section outlines the core concepts derived from _"Product Roadmaps Relaunched"_ by C. Todd Lombardo et al., and _"The Lean Product Playbook"_ by Dan Olsen.

### 2.1 Key Concepts

#### 1. Product Vision and Strategy

A clear product vision and strategy provide direction and align the team’s efforts with the company's long-term goals. They ensure that all stakeholders understand the intended impact and value of the product.

- **Vision Statement:**  
  Defines the ultimate goal of the product.

- **Strategic Objectives:**  
  Long-term goals that align with business objectives and market needs.

- **Market Analysis:**  
  Understanding the target market, including size, trends, and competitive landscape to identify unique value propositions.

#### 2. Product Roadmap

A product roadmap serves as a strategic guide outlining the planned development and delivery of features over time. It ensures alignment among team members and stakeholders on priorities, timelines, and expectations.

- **Timeframes:**  
  Defines periods (e.g., quarters, months) for feature releases and milestones.

- **Themes or Epics:**  
  High-level categories that group related features or initiatives, providing context and alignment with strategic goals.

- **Features and Initiatives:**  
  Specific functionalities or projects planned for development, prioritized based on value and feasibility.

- **Status Indicators:**  
  Visual cues (e.g., color codes, icons) representing the progress or status of each roadmap item.

#### 3. Product-Market Fit

Achieving product-market fit ensures that our products meet strong market demand and effectively solve users' problems. It validates that the product resonates with its target audience, thereby increasing the likelihood of sustained success and growth.

- **Customer Validation:**  
  Engaging with users to confirm that the product meets their needs and solves their problems.

- **Value Proposition Alignment:**  
  Ensuring that the product's value propositions align with what the market demands.

- **Iterative Feedback:**  
  Continuously refining the product based on user feedback to better meet market needs.

#### 4. User Research and Personas

Understanding user needs, behaviors, and motivations is essential for creating products that truly serve their audience. User research and the development of detailed personas guide design and development decisions, ensuring that features are relevant, valuable, and user-friendly.

- **User Research:**  
  Conduct surveys, interviews, and usability tests to gather insights into user needs and challenges.

- **Personas:**  
  Creating representative user profiles that embody the characteristics of target user segments.

#### 5. Product Requirements and OKRs

Clearly defined product requirements and Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) ensure that development efforts are focused, measurable, and aligned with the product vision. They provide a roadmap for what needs to be built and the outcomes that define success, facilitating accountability and progress tracking.

- **OKRs (Objectives and Key Results):**

  - **Objective:** Enhance user engagement and satisfaction.
