## 10. Appendix
### 10.1. Glossary

- **Debt Snowball Strategy:** A debt repayment method where the user begins by paying off debts with the smallest balances first. This approach builds psychological momentum, as eliminating smaller debts quickly provides a sense of accomplishment and motivation to tackle larger debts.

- **Debt Avalanche Strategy:** A debt repayment method that prioritizes paying off debts with the highest interest rates first. This strategy focuses on minimizing the total interest paid over time, making it the most cost-effective approach in the long run.

- **Hybrid Debt Repayment Strategy:** A debt repayment method that combines the strengths of both the Debt Snowball and Debt Avalanche strategies. It allows users to experience early wins by paying off smaller debts (like the Snowball method) while also focusing on reducing overall interest costs by targeting high-interest debts (like the Avalanche method).

- **Debt Snowflake Strategy:** A method of accelerating debt repayment where users make additional, smaller payments—either one-time or recurring—towards their debts. These "snowflakes" can be applied on top of regular payments, helping to reduce the principal balance faster and potentially save on interest.
